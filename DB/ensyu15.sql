1.SELECT TO_NUMBER('15000') + 5000 AS 計算 FROM DUAL;
SELECT TO_NUMBER('\15,000','L999,999') + 5000 AS 計算 FROM DUAL;
SELECT TO_NUMBER('100-100','999-999') + 5000 AS 計算 FROM DUAL;

2.SELECT TRUNC(TO_NUMBER('\28,578','L999G999'),-2) AS 端数切捨て FROM DUAL;

3.SELECT TO_CHAR(MOD(TO_NUMBER('23,527.97','99,999.99'),5),'$9.99') AS 計算 FROM DUAL;
#解答SELECT TO_CHAR(MOD(TO_NUMBER('23,527.97','99G999D99'),5),'$9D99') AS 計算 FROM DUAL;

4.SELECT TO_NUMBER(REPLACE('295-5585','-'),'9999999') / 100 AS 変換 FROM DUAL;
